# PHP Microservices
This is the code repository for [PHP Microservices](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/php-microservices?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787125377), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The world is moving away from bulky, unreliable, and high-maintenance PHP applications, to small, easy-to-maintain and highly available microservices and the pressing need is for PHP developers to understand the criticalities in building effective microservices that scale at large. This book will be a reliable resource, and one that will help you to develop your skills and teach you techniques for building reliable microservices in PHP.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1,3,8,10,11,12 doesn't have any code.


The code will look like the following:
```
    version: '2'
    services:
```

To follow along with this book, you’ll need a computer with an Internet connection to download the required software and Docker images. At some point, you will need at least a text editor or an IDE, and we highly recommend PHPStorm for this job.
